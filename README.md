#Activate windows if needed

This is the source code for a batch script that can be used to automate the activation of supported Windows and Office products using a local KMS server emulator, or an external KMS server. The script is designed to be unattended and smart enough not to override the permanent activation of products (Windows or Office), only non-activated products will be KMS-activated (if supported). The script is intended to provide 24/7 activation, without needing interaction from the user. Some security programs may report infected files due to KMS emulation, but this is a false-positive as long as the script is downloaded from a trusted source.
